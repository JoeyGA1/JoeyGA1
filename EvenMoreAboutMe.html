<h1>Even More About Me</h1>
<p style=""> While I am a very positive, confident, and good caring person, I  have a life and want to live it to the fullest. My favorite activities are video games, soccer, and excersing.The reason I love video games a lot is because when my mom or older brother wasn't home to take care of us. My mom would tell us to stay inside the house and be care to not open the door to anyone. I realized this would be very boring for me and my younger brother. We started on a gameboy, then went on to a gamecube and a playstation 2. Currently I own a very high end PC that has a 3090 in it. <br>

    and many more but the main one currently is Valorant.<br><br>
    My love for soccer started when I was 6. I would always want to play with everyone and always try to kick it. I would get very sad and upset if I didn't win the game. I absolutely hated losing and I grew up watching the professionals play.This would motivate me a lot and I didn't get seriously good at it until I was 16 and 17. Growing up I realized that if I wanted to go professional in the US, it would cost thousands and it is really difficult despite the fact I was very skilled at it. My family didn't have the time to take me to games and we wouldn't be able to afford all the equipment and all the things an academy would ask for. I stopped aiming for the proffesional goal around 18 and started to play for fun. When my friends ask me to play, my main goal is to fun with sport and I also still continue to watch it. <br><br>

    I have a girlfriend, named Yeleina Cajamarca&nbsp; of 6 years and I love her a lot. Currently we've been dating for 6 years. I met her through elementary and we started talking more on social media. Since then, its has been a loving journey. I have met her family and have done things in life early that I don't believe I could with anyone else. We have been to Dominican Republic together. We have been to South Carolina togehter. We are planning to go to New York together sometime this year.<br>
<img src="assets/IMG-1563.JPG" width="150" height="300" alt=""/>    I have a blue nose pitbul named Tobi as well. One thing about me is I really treat dogs really nicely. I kind of have a mentality about them how they are better than humans because they way they treat us regardless of how we treat them. Tobi is clear example of this. He will comeback to us and is scared of anyone who he doesn't know. He protects our house and has his funny moments that we all laugh to.This dog sleeps with me and my brother and treats us so nicely.<br>
