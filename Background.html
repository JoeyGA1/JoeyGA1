<h1>My Background</h1>
	<p>The way I grew up was very harsh. Before I say anything I want you to understand my older brother's actions do not make him the person he is today.<br>
  <br>
  At the years of age 1-4, I want to say I was living good. My dad being the man he was and my mom being the mom she was, I was living in good hands.They were taking care of me and my younger brother and older brother very well. If this continued I would with no doubt continue a positive and fun route through my childhood and early teenage years.<br>
  <br>
  At age 5, this is when the tree falls on my current route and I'm forced to go a different way. My dad leaves the family and sells almost everything we had and lost nearly my whole mom's life and my brothers. He sold things I possiblily couldn't imagine. Being a kid at the time I didn't know, you know how that goes. I past kindergarten easily. 1st grade and 2nd second grade easily. While it was easy, dealing with my older brother wasn't. He was treating the whole family unfairly and because of this, me and my younger brother faced the worst of it when my mom was at work. My older brother at time being 15-18 was treating us uncompletely fair and this really affected us later on especially my younger brother. My older brother would put himself up before he would put us. I remember days where I would look out the window for hours waiting for my mom to get home. Since we were very poor since our dad left us, we didn't have much to eat. My mom would give money to my older brother because she believed he was responsible enough to be a big brother. This wasn't the case, me and my younger brother saw how he would feed his friends before us. We would see how he put his ex girlfriend's family before us. How he would use our money for himself.It was hard for me to see completetly through his lies.<br>
  <br>
  3rd grade I start facing a bit of difficult as I noticed I would wear the same clothes to school. Same in 4th grade. This kind of made me a bit sad but thankful towards my mom whenever she got me something.I would see a lot kids have cool shoes and cool outfits and I wondered why my mom couldn't buy it. Since I played soccer a lot and watched a good amount, this would help a lot since everytime I scored I had felt like I was actually on TV celebrating. This helped a lot because I always looked forward to playing soccer when and made my attendance way better. At the age of 12, the fire happened. My family was living in a 1 bedroom apartments since we were poor. It was getting better but a fire had happened because the neighbors left their stove on. My older brother wasn't there but me, my mom, younger brother and an old friend was there. We had no escape route and because of this we had to jump out the 3rd floor. We ended up in pain and my younger brother broke his pelvis. This left me paranoid about sleeping with my family for a good year. I asked myself did we deserve so much pain in this life? My mom was grinding her work life and me and my younger brother kept going to school like normal.  After 6 months of the fire, we moved into another apartment again. This area made a lot of things take place. I went to 5th grade living here and it was okay experience. <br>
  <br>
  At this point in time ages 13-15 were very difficult. I would go outside to play with people but those people were bad influences. I wasn't taught that hanging with certain people made you a certain person and how they influence your descions. I was trespassing with a few people and they got caught tresspassing but I didn't. The people who were caught, one of them ended up telling on me and I realized that those people weren't the people to hang out with. At age 15 I entrap myself into my house and I only go outside to practice or play soccer. I realized my brothers would finally want to play with me if those people would play with me. I hated the fact that I would always ask my brothers to play with me and they would say no to me but when other people came around they would finally play with me. So I left them and went back inside my house. I didn't like anyone there up to the point and stopped trying to be the cool person.I ended up dating my current girlfriend at 13 and she would help me a lot. It seemed like everyone outside of that neighborhood was a good person. My girlfriend pushed me to become a good person<br>
  <br>
  At age 16 and 17, we end moving again, but to a house. I loved living here. I practiced soccer everyday in the backyard and it made me really great at the sport. I would walk from school to home, vice versa.I got in trouble with my girlfriend but we were patient enough to deal with it. I missed living there despite we were still poor. At age 17 and 18, I was mature enough to realize a lot of things about my older brother and younger brother. It seemed like god had pointed a finger at me and told me I have to be the person that lets my mom rest. We ended up moving once again but this time a townhome. I didn't have my own room and I slept in the living room. I realized all the reasons why we were still moving, why we were still in poverty and why we were still struggling. Both of my brothers dropped out of highschool. I was about to as well but I realized if I wanted to enjoy my life and be supportive of my girlfriend, I would have to be financially stable.<br>
  <br>
  During this time, covid hit hard, it was difficult to just find a retail job or any job. I applied but since I didn't have experience it was hard. I then ended up working in landscaping with my girlfriend's step dad and his friend and they both helped me a lot. Since my mind couldn't bare with all the realization, all the things my older brother did, how hard life is truly, I would lose my attitude and my mind would be distracted all the time. After I was dropped from the landscaping job, I got a job at a retail store and realized I couldn't work there for the rest of my life or any job like that for the rest of my life. I end up getting my highschool deploma. The lord blessed me but I was still in a way mad at everything. I should've applied to college after but I didn't feel ready. I would argue with my older brother everyday at the age of 18. Blame him for the person he made me today and how he made my younger brother fall into depression and drop out of highschool. Blame him for not getting my mom out of work life she has beeng doing for 20 years. Blame him for still lieing till today. I realized the whole person he was this whole time. How he wasn't an older brother to me or my younger brother but yet wanted to be treated or seen as a dad.<br>
  <br>
  I realized my retail job wasn't paying enough so I ended working at amazon. I was working 3 12s Thursday through Saturday nights. I did this for one year and 6 months before finally applying to Waketech. I realized that if I didn't want to be like my older brother and if I wanted to take care of someone before myself, I need to get my education set and I need to be finacially stable. What motivaed me all this time was my girlfriend and she was the reason why I always kept pushing this whole time. I owe her and my mom the world for doing the greatest things they possbily could. As in my older brother, I still have some strong hate and I hate it because he is my brother after all, but all I can do in the moment is cope. I blamed him and my dad for not teaching me basic things like how to respect a woman and how to socialize with people. They didn't teach me skills or anything. I did by myself for my mom and because of my girlfriend.<br>
  <br>
  As of today, I still work 3 12s Thursday through Saturday nights and doing Waketech at the same time. What motivates me is to get out of this insane cycle and my girlfriend who's always stuck by my side. It is the winner's mentality and the grind I realized I have to do to enjoy life.<br>
